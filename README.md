## Description

Welcome Google Book Search, a website perfect for those who love to read. Without an account you can search for books and read a brief description while marveling at a cover image, however that only scratches the surface of this website. If you make an account you can save books to your account, so if you have favorites or a list of books you want to get around to reading this is the perfect website to make said list. You can also remove books from your list.
